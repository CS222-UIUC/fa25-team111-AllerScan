# AllerScan
Nearly 1 in 11 people have food allergies in the United States of America. For those in that group, their allergies control the food they buy, avoid, and consume. Allergens also take away precious time, with 3 to 5 minutes per product on average being used to decide on a purchase based on the allergens from the label. Our app AllerScan is a solution that gives users the comfort of safety in their food purchases, along with giving back the time wasted by staring at food labels.

AllerScan is an Android mobile app that uses food product barcodes to check food labels and informs the user whether a product is safe to consume. AllerScan achieves this by using the mobile phone's built-in camera to scan barcodes, with manual barcode insertion available as needed. When creating a profile, the user will be asked to insert their allergens, which, when a barcode is scanned, will be cross-checked against the food label's listed ingredients. All of this happens within seconds, saving the user minutes of reading and eye strain with a quick response prioritizing user safety above all else. 

But what makes AllerScan special compared to competitors? AllerScan does not have any form of data collection or "middle-man" interaction. This means that the user's data is truly theirs, with everything being stored and processed locally on device. This gives the user the ability to have full control over their data without the possibility of leaks, data selling, or unwanted sharing of user info. AllerScan offers the same abilities as its competitors without intruding on user privacy.
